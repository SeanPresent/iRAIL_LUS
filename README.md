## Project Introduction
**Introduction:** Research applying Deep Learning to lung ultrasound findings using the BLUE protocol <br>
**Objective:** The BLUE protocol, designed to find the cause in patients with acute respiratory distress, shows a high diagnostic accuracy of over 90.5%. However, due to the nature of ultrasound diagnostics, interpretations can vary depending on the operator. This research aims to develop a model that can assist in achieving an accuracy level similar to that of experienced examiners.
